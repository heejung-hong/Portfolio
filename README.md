### User Stories
1. As a small business owner, I need a web designer to design the business website for the products we sell and be able to purchase products through the site.
2. As a nonprofit organization, we will need a web developer who can create a website for our organization and be able to have a way for donate money.
3. As a bakery, we would like to have a website to display our menu and place catering orders with calendars and delivery confirmation and notification emails sent to the customer.


### Next Steps

- I would like to have images appear in the background while scrolling through the website.
